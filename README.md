# A Unified Memoryâ€“Learning Agent

This repository contains the code, simulation scripts, and experimental results
for the paper:

**"Unified Memoryâ€“Learning Algorithm for LLMs and Agents" (2025)**

It integrates:
- Token-Attentive Dream Memory (TADM)
- Episodic Memory Graphs (EMG)
- Short-Term and Long-Term Memory (STM, LTM)
- Cue discovery and auto-promotion
- Emotion modeling with PAD
- Introspection, purpose, and character
